# Amazon Scraper tool

Simple function that will get product prices and other information from product URLs provided in a csv file.

Fetches prices from European and American stores.


## Getting Started

Once you add a few URL's with the products you want to follow, Amazon_Scraper.py will take care of the rest.

Make sure to use this folder structure to avoid issues with file paths.

Make sure to read the article where I provide a basic overview.


## Prerequisites

You might need to pip install xlrd because we work with excel also. Or you can change the output to csv as well.

BeautifulSoup, requests, pandas, the usual!
